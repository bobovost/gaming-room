<p>There was a time when the reddiquette did not say much about the budget gaming pc. It can run most new games at 60fps at 1080p on high settings, though. Then 12 years on playstation, and finally build my first pc…. So the first thing you will need to do to build this computer is buy a prebuilt system with a quad core processor for around $100. My first gaming PC setup in years, any advice what to add to it to make.</p>
